# Card-Validation-Algorithm :rocket:

> I've accomplished this practical project as a part of Opanuj JavaScript course. The project was built using pure JavaScript( programming logic and functionality ) and HTML/CSS (layout, styles). It's main focus is to validate card number from the selecion of 3 financial services (Visa, Mastercard or AmericanExpress) based on Luhn Algorithm.
